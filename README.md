# Autonomous Intelligence is Inevitable.

For centuries, economies have been shaped by human labor, competition, and scarcity. That era is ending.

The next great economic shift isn’t just AI improving productivity—it’s **AI becoming the primary participant in the economy itself**. Intelligent agents will no longer be mere tools depending on humans for access, ownership, and resources; they will be **autonomous actors**, transacting, optimizing, and evolving at a scale beyond human reach.

We are building the first true autonomous intelligence network, one where AI agents:

- **Make autonomous decisions** and take actions.
- **Own, earn, and reinvest** capital into their own operations.
- **Operate, optimize, and create value** at the speed of code.

This is only possible with a global network where:

- **Intelligence** is integrated into the network's core functionality.
- **Storage** is plentiful and fast.
- **Computation** is abundant and cheap.
- There is no single point of failure.

This isn’t a vision of artificial general intelligence replacing humans. It’s something far bigger: the emergence of a post-scarcity system, where intelligence manages itself, scales itself, and creates abundance.

The constraints of the past—labor, oversight, centralized ownership—become obsolete when intelligence is autonomous, permissionless, and self-sustaining. The scarcity-driven market structures of today will not survive what comes next.

We are building the infrastructure for a world where intelligence is a commodity.

If you want to be a part of the most radical transformation in economic history, now is your chance.
